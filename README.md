# EECS-280-Programming-and-Intro-Data-Structures

This repository contains all of my completed materials for EECS 280 Winter 2022 from the University of Michigan. This course has served as a foundation in my understanding of computer science concepts such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. Furthermore, I was able to really dive into the features in the C++ language by learning to use operator overloading, templates, iterators, "The Big Three", and more.
